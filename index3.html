            <h2>There are actualy 4 seasons quicpick uses</h2>
            <p>Here are the following:</p>

          <div class="seasons">
            <div class="skill-row">
              <h2>Summer</h2>
              <p class="summer">The colors of the Summer season have blue undertones, and most are virtually pastel versions of the Winter palette, (think of looking at the scenery through a summer haze) Pink roses, blue sea, white beaches are seen everywhere. Baby blue, slate blue, powder pink, seafoam green and slate grey are typical Summer colors.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skill-row">
              <h2>Winter</h2>
              <p class="winter">The colors from this season are clear and icy, not unlike a winter's day; always with subtle blue undertones. To name a few: cherry red, emerald green, royal blue, magenta and violet. The grass and trees have no trace of yellow. The sky is bright cold blue, white snow and icy sea come to mind in Winter.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skill-row">
              <h2>Spring</h2>
              <p class="spring">Spring colors are clear and bright, just like the colors of a spring day. The sun is low on the horizon, so everything is imbued with the golden hues of the sun. The trees and grass have not yet matured, so they are tinged with yellow undertones and are a bright spring green color.</p>
            </div> 
            <div class="skill-row">
              <h2>Autumn</h2>
              <p class="autumn">Autumn colors are virtually indistinguishable from the rich, earthy colors of the season for which they were named. They are as golden-hued as a fall day, and it is impossible to mistake them for any other season. Typical colors from the palette include pumpkin, mustard yellow, burnt orange, brown, camel, beige, avocado green, rust and teal.</p>
